# About this project

I got so tired from looking for a perfect repo to copy ESLint, Prettier and other configs that I need every time when I am starting a new TypeScript or JavaScript project!

So I decided to finally organize everything in one place.

## Available configs

1. [ESLint](https://github.com/olesiaMartushkanova/code.configs-javascript-typescript/tree/main/ESLint)
2. [Prettier](https://github.com/olesiaMartushkanova/code.configs-javascript-typescript/tree/main/Prettier)

## How to use them

Copy from here and paste it into your project :wink:
